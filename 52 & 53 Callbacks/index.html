    <h1>Callback Hell or Pyramid Of Doom</h1>  
     <p>
        Callback Hell, also known as the Pyramid of Doom, occurs in JavaScript when you have several nested callbacks, often in asynchronous code. As more asynchronous functions are called, the code becomes deeply nested and difficult to read and maintain. This creates a "pyramid" structure that makes the code look like a triangular or stair-step shape, hence the term "Pyramid of Doom."</p>
