    <h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
    <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript can help developers write more maintainable, scalable, and efficient code for complex applications <br> In JavaScript, OOP is implemented using prototypal inheritance, which involves linking an object to a prototype. Prototypes contain all methods that are accessible to all objects linked to the prototype</p>
    <p><h2>It Has Four Pillars ---------- </h2>
        1. <b>Encapsulation</b> = Encapsulation is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that bundles data and methods together into a single unit. It can also refer to limiting direct access to some of that data. 
        <br><br>
        2. <b>Inheritance</b> = Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It's a core feature that enables programmers to: <br><br>
        3. <b>Polymorphism</b> = Polymorphism is a core feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a single interface to be used for different types of entities. It's also the ability of a programming language to represent multiple types with a single symbol<br><br>
        4. <b>Abstraction</b> = In object-oriented programming (OOP), abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary information and displaying only what's essential. It's an important part of OOP because it helps users interact with real-world objects in a simplified manner.
